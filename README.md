# Ostara

[Ostara](https://ostara.dev/) is an open source desktop app designed to simplify the management and monitoring of Spring Boot applications. Ostara connects to services using the Spring Boot Actuator API. It’s a Spring Boot Admin alternative that aims to make the process more user-friendly and simplify the setup process by removing the need for dependencies and changes to your code. It allows you to gain insights into application performance, troubleshoot issues, and perform actions on your services across different environments.

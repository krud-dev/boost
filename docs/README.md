Ostara is a modern tool for managing and monitoring actuator-enabled microservices that aims to make the process more user-friendly and straightforward.&#x20;

One of our main goals with Ostara was to create a tool that just works out of the box, without needing anything besides a functioning Actuator API on the other end. ([why-ostara.md](getting-started/why-ostara.md "mention"))

Ostara allows you to gain insights into the performance and health of your microservices by providing real-time monitoring of critical metrics such as CPU and memory usage.

One of the key benefits of Ostara is its simplicity. The tool is designed to be easy to use and requires minimal setup. All you need is a running instance of your microservice with Actuator enabled, and you can start monitoring and managing it with Ostara.

# Creating / Updating Applications

### Creating an Application

To create an application, click the `+`  symbol at the top left corner of the navigation tree and click on `Create Application`. You can also right click any free space on the navigation tree and click on `Create Application`. Alternatively, you can also right click on a folder which will create your new application inside of it.

In this dialog, you can change the application's alias, authentication settings and icon.

You can also create an application along with its instances at the same time. This is covered in [creating-updating-instances.md](../instances/creating-updating-instances.md "mention")

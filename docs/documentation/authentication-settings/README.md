# Authentication Settings

Ostara allows you to set the authentication settings for each [application](../applications/) you wish to manage within the app. Authentication can also cascade using the [inherit.md](types/inherit.md "mention") type, allowing you to set authentication at the folder level which will cascade to all apps and folders below it.

The following authentication types are supported:

* [none.md](types/none.md "mention")
* [inherit.md](types/inherit.md "mention")
* [basic.md](types/basic.md "mention")
* [bearer-token.md](types/bearer-token.md "mention")
* [header.md](types/header.md "mention")
* [query-string.md](types/query-string.md "mention")

# Creating / Updating Instances

Instances require an Actuator URL to be created, you can create one or more at the same time. It is not possible to configure authentication settings at the instance level, as the instance always takes its authentication settings from the app.

### Creating an Instance

There are two ways to create a new instance.

The first is by clicking on the `+` sign in the upper left corner, or anywhere on the tree and selecting  `Create Instance`. When using this approach, you will also be required to supply an application name, and a new application will be created to house your instance.

The second is by right clicking on an existing app and selecting `Add Instance`, this will automatically pair the new instance with the app upon creation.

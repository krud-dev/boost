# Togglz

### Overview

With Togglz's [Spring Boot Starter](https://www.togglz.org/documentation/spring-boot-starter.html) is installed, Ostara allows you to view and interact with your instance's features. In it, you're able to to toggle features on or off either as a group or individually, as well as view your strategy's parameters if set.

### Usage

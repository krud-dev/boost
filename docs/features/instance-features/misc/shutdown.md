# Shutdown

### Overview

Ostara allows you to shut down individual instances if the [Shutdown Ability](../../abilities.md) is active. To perform a shutdown, right click on the instance in the tree or click on the instance icon when the instance is focused and click on **Shutdown**. A confirmation dialog will pop up, after which the instance will begin shutting down.
